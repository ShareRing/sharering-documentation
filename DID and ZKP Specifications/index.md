# Identity Protocol

ShareRing's Identity Protocol is built on a foundation of self-sovereign identity standards, privacy-preserving cryptography, and high-performance smart contracts.

## Core Specifications

*   **[SHR DID Method Specification](./did-method-spec.md)**: Defines how identities are created, resolved, and managed on ShareLedger (`did:shr`).
*   **[CW1056 Identity Standard](./cw1056-standard.md)**: The technical specification for the smart contract registry that powers the DID method.
*   **[ZkVCT Specification](./zkvct-spec.md)**: Details the Zero-Knowledge Verifiable Credential Token protocol for private data sharing.
